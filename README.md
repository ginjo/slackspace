# SlackSpace

A Slack integration to send Rackspace Monitoring alarm notifications to a Slack channel.

SlackSpace is a Ruby/Sinatra app that receives webhook notifications from Rackspace,
translates them into something Slack can work with, and pushes them to a Slack
incomming-webhook URL.

## Usage

You can download this app and run it on your own server, or you can use a live demo of this app running on Heroku.

Note that this app does not save any of your information. Nor does it have any access to information in your Slack account(s) or your Rackspace account(s). This app is merely a translator running between Rackspace and Slack.

### Use the Demo

* Create an incomming webhook for your slack team.
* Copy the URI path of the webhook (just the part with the encrypted key, including the slashes within).
* Create a webhook notification on Rackspace and point it to this url:

        https://slackspace.herokuapp.com/slack/webhook/?key=<your/unique/incomming/webhook/key>

* Attach the Rackspace notification to an alarm of one of your Rackspace monitors.
    

### Run this app on your own server

* Download the app.
* Bundle install
* Bundle exec rackup - or whatever commands are necessary for your application server.
* Point your Rackspace notification webhook url to this app:

        https://your.custom.domain/slack/webhook/?key=<your/unique/incomming/webhook/key>
