# SlackSpace

A Slack integration to send Rackspace Monitoring alarm notifications to a Slack channel.

SlackSpace is a Ruby/Sinatra app that receives webhook notifications from Rackspace,
translates them into something Slack can work with,
and pushes them to a Slack incoming-webhook URL.

## Coming Soon

The SlackSpace demo at heroku is developing into a full-fledged service. It will create Rackspace/Slack integrations entirely from within the SlackSpace web app. SlackSpace will tap into the API services of Slack and Rackspace to manage the integration, so you won't need to create Slack incoming webhooks or copy-paste ugly urls into your Rackspace notifications any more.

Integrations created with this legacy app will continue to work, and I will leave the current code in this repo up on Github. Keep a watch here for more info on the upcoming SlackSpace service.

## Legacy App

You can download this app and run it on your own server,
or you can use a live demo of this app running on Heroku.

Note that this app:

* Does not save any of your information.
* Does not access information in your Slack accounts or Rackspace accounts.
* Is a translator running between Rackspace notifications and Slack incoming webhooks.
* Is currently ALPHA. Functionality is mostly stable, API is not.

### Use the Demo

* Create an incoming webhook on Slack for your team.
* Copy the URI path of the webhook, just the part with the encrypted key,
  including the slashes within, but not the 'http://host.domain.com' part.
  Ex: nfheus98Hnb/HYGGLPzy6/nNHJKC&BW6tgfcu
* Create a webhook notification on Rackspace with this url:

        https://slackspace.herokuapp.com/slack/webhook/?key=<your/unique/incoming/webhook/key>

* Attach the Rackspace notification to an alarm of one of your Rackspace monitors.
  See the Rackspace Intelligence section of your account for API and help.
    

### Run this app on your own server

* Download the app.
* Bundle install
* Bundle exec rackup, or whatever commands you use to boot apps.
* Point your Rackspace notification webhook url to this app:

        https://your.custom.domain/slack/webhook/?key=<your/unique/incoming/webhook/key>
